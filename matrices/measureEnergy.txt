## Lab04 – Default Power Profile (assumed Balanced)
Machine: rasalas  
CPU: Intel(R) Core(TM) i9-14900  
Power Profile: Not detected (assumed Balanced)  
Compiler: gcc  
Flags: -O0  
Executable: matrix_base_gcc-O0.exe  
Matrix Size: 3072 x 3072  
Frobenius Norm: 2.58459e+07

Fastest run (out of 3):
Time: 218.50 seconds  
Energy: 1840.31 J (1840305775 µJ)

Methodology:
Used the readEnergy.sh wrapper script to capture energy usage via RAPL counters. Repeated the test 3 times and recorded the fastest result. Power governor could not be detected, assumed Balanced setting is used by default.

Next step: compare with other machines and/or power profiles if available.
